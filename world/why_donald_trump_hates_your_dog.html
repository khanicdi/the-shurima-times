        Reaching for nouns, he said that al-Baghdadi died "like a dog".
        I wasn't aware that canines expired in a signature fashion,
        but Trump knows best, even if he doesn't know so very many words.
        About a week later, when he took characteristically nasty note of Beto O'Rourke's
        decision to abandon the presidental race, he said that O'Rourke quit "like a dog".
        <br/><br/>
        Some similes demand repetition.
        <br/><br/>
        This wasn't one of them.
        <br/><br/>
        But a lack of verbal ingenuity never stopped Trump. And an animus
        toward a certain animal has long, well, hounded him.
        <br/><br/>
        In his boundless unoriginality, he has likened women he dislikes to dogs.
        In his infinite incohernce, he has repeatedly tweeted of people being
        fired like dogs. I personally haven't met all that many gainfully employed pooches,
        unless digging holes in the backyard is a profession, and when those excavators
        received orders to desist, none of them got a pink slip and a referral to career counseling.
        <br/><br/>
        Trump did recently make the acquaintance - from a distance - of a dog
        with a bona fide job. That dog is a Belgian Malinois named Conan. And
        Conan's job, brilliantly executed, was to find, chase and corner al-Baghdadi. 
        Trump called Connan "a beautiful dog, a talented dog." The New York Post put Conan's picture 
        on its front page, along with the headline "Zero Bark Thirty." Trump also tweeted a Photoshopped 
        image in which he draped a medal around Conan's neck.
        <br/><br/>
        So this Malinois warrants decoration while "a dog" gets derision? Or is it
        just that every dog has its day? I used to believe that adage until Trump came along.
        He has had more than <i>1,000</i> days in the presidency, even as the White House goes to the dogs.
