  <p>
    Efforts by Apple, Facebook and Google to address the California housing crunch must
    contend with the forces that created it.

    SAN FRANCISCO - A mile from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino lies
    the sun-faded carass of the Vallco Shopping Mall. At the moment it
    consists or empty, buff-colored buildings, acres of black asphalt and a pile
    of rubble where the parking garage used to be.
    <br/><br/>
    About a year ago, a developer submitted a proposal to build 2,400
    apartments on the site, half of them subsidized to put rents below the
    market rate. The city approved the plan reluctantly, and afterward a
    community group sued. The project is stuck in court.
    <br/><br/>
    Stories like that hang heavy over Apple's $2.5 billion plan, announced
    Monday, to help solve the dire shortage of affordable housing that has 
    come to dominate life and politics in the most populous state. The pledge
    came weeks after Facebook announced $1 biilion for a similar program, 
    and months after Google did the same. Earlier, in January, Microsoft
    committed $500 million for affordable housing in the Seattle area 
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond public relations, the moves amount to a statement from some of
    the tech industry's largest employers that they are starting to take a more
    active role in addressing the chronic regional housing shortage that
    makes their expansion difficult - not just for their employees, but for the
    public at large.
    <br/><br/>
    But don't expect the money to make much of a difference. A few billion 
    dollars doesn't buy a lot in California's punitively expensive housing 
    market. Even if it did, the companies' announcements were accompanied 
    by crucial yet mostly unanswered questions like where, how and when 
    this money will be spent. And as the Vallco struggle illustrates, the 
    biggest question is the one California has long wrestled with: how to get 
    much-needed housing built when local governments and homeowners do 
    everything they can to prevent it. 
    <br/><br/>
    "These investments are an opportunity, because clearly the tech 
    companies want to engage and want their money to make a difference," 
    said Carol Galante, faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing 
    Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. "And yet, this 
    scattershot approach, not just with each of them putting out their own 
    announcements, but not having them coordinated with the larger 
    conversation about how we are going to make the public policy changes 
    that the Legislature is strugging with - unless you marry those things 
    together, it's not going to work."
    <br/><br/>
    The housing programs announced by Apple and other companies are not 
    philanthropy, but commitments to make affordable housing <em>investments</em> 
    -for profit - in the form of corporte land and money. The details vary, 
    but each company said it would allow housing development on land it 
    already owned, and issue loans whose terms and interest rates are 
    implicitly more generous than the terms that developers currenty get 
    from banks, but whose true costs will take years to figure out.
    <br/><br/>
    Apple said its plan would, among other things, create an affordable - 
    housing fund that would give the state and others "an open line of credit" 
    to build more affordable housing beyond land that it owns. The company 
    expects to make money from the financing, but for the returns to be lower 
    than what it would earn on investments-grade securities where corporate 
    holdings traditionally lie...
